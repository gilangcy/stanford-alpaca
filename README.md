# [Reproducing] Stanford Alpaca: An Instruction-following LLaMA Model
This is the repo for reproducing [Stanford Alpaca : An Instruction-following LLaMA Model](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca/blob/main/README.md). We finetune some of LlaMa2-based large language model using medical QA dataset. The repo contains:

- The [5K data](#dataset) conversations between patients and physicians used for fine-tuning the model.
- The code for [Preparation data](#data-preparation).
- The code for [Fine Tuning the Model](#fine-tuning).
- The link for [Testing the Model](#testing-the-model).

## Dataset
We using the 5k generated dataset by [Chat Doctor](https://github.com/Kent0n-Li/ChatDoctor). The dataset is a generated conversations between patients and physicians from ChatGPT GenMedGPT-5k and disease database. Dataset also currated and modified to Indonesian Language Based. 

[`GenMedGPT-5k-id.json`](./GenMedGPT-5k-id.json) contains 5K instruction-following data we used for fine-tuning the LlaMa model. This JSON file is a list of dictionaries, each dictionary contains the following fields:

- `instruction`: `str`, describes the task the model should perform. Each of the 52K instructions is unique.
- `input`: `str`, optional context or input for the task. For example, when the instruction is "Summarize the following article", the input is the article. Around 40% of the examples have an input.
- `output`: `str`, the answer to the instruction as generated by `text-davinci-003`.

If you're interested in fine-tuning with your own data, it's essential to adhere to the default prompt format that the model used during its pre-training phase. The prompt for LlaMa 2 is structured similarly to this:

```
<s>[INST] <<SYS>>
{{ instruction }}
<</SYS>>

{{ input }} [/INST] {{ output }} </s>
```

Meanwhile, the prompt for PolyLM and InternLM (adapted to Indonesian) is structured similarly to this:

```
Di bawah ini adalah instruksi yang menjelaskan tugas, dipasangkan dengan masukan yang memberikan konteks lebih lanjut. Tulis tanggapan yang melengkapi permintaan dengan tepat.

Instruksi:
{instruction}

Masukan:
{input}

Tanggapan:
{output}
```

## Finetuning the Model
We fine-tune our models based on the step from Stanford Alpaca. We choose to train some LLama-based model. The model that we finetune are PolyLM-1.7B, LlaMa-2-7B, InternLM-7B with the following hyperparameters:

| Hyperparameter | PolyLM-1.7B | LLaMA-7B | InternLM-7B |
|----------------|------------ |----------|-------------|
| Batch size     | 128         | 128      | 128         |
| Learning rate  | 3e-4        | 3e-4     | 3e-4        |
| Epochs         | 3           | 3        | 3           |
| Max length     | 256         | 256      | 256         |
| Weight decay   | 0           | 0        | 0           |

To reproduce our fine-tuning runs for LLaMA, first install the requirements

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The code for finetuning is available at [`fine-tuning.ipynb`](https://github.com/gilangcy/stanford-alpaca/blob/main/fine-tuning.ipynb) with four sections of pre-preocessing data, fine-tuning with LlaMa 2, fine-tuning with PolyLM, and fine-tuning with InternLM.
